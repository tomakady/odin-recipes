  <h4>Directions</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with
      cooking spray.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons water, parsley, and 1/4 teaspoon
      black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion; sprinkle
      with remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, Italian seasoning, and salt.
      Cook 7 minutes or until beef is crumbled and no longer pink, stirring
      occasionally. Add garlic; cook 1 minute more or until fragrant. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add remaining water, undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, vinegar, and red
      pepper flakes to the skillet. Reduce heat and simmer meat sauce 10
      minutes, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assemble lasagna by spreading about 1 cup meat sauce over bottom of the
      baking dish. Place 3 dry noodles over sauce. Top with 2 cups meat sauce,
      half of the ricotta mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 cup Parmesan
      cheese. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of noodles. Top with remaining
      meat sauce and remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spray underside of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover dish tightly
      with foil. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake 15 minutes more or until
      cheese melts and sauce is bubbly. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
